# Bank Marketing – Comparing Classification Models

## Project Overview
This project compares multiple classification algorithms to predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit product based on demographic and campaign data.

## Business Problem
Accurate prediction allows the bank to reduce unnecessary calls and better allocate marketing resources.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from a Portuguese banking institution and includes demographic, social, and marketing attributes.

## Models Compared
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine

## Evaluation Metric
ROC-AUC was used to evaluate model performance due to class imbalance.

## Key Results
Logistic Regression achieved the highest ROC-AUC (~0.93), followed by SVM, Decision Tree, and k-NN.
